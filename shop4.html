       <p>The Taj Mahal is an iconic white marble mausoleum located in Agra, India. It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth in 1631. The Taj Mahal's architecture is a masterpiece of Mughal architecture and is renowned for its stunning beauty and symmetry. Here are some key architectural features of the Taj Mahal.
Design & Layout : The Taj Mahal is designed as a perfect square with four identical facades, each featuring a massive arched doorway with intricate calligraphy and decorative elements. It sits on a raised platform, which is also a square.
Materials:The primary building material is white marble, which was quarried from the Makrana quarries in Rajasthan. It is believed that over 1,000 elephants were used to transport the marble to the construction site.
Dome : The most distinctive feature of the Taj Mahal is its large central dome. The dome is often described as an onion dome or an amrud (guava) dome because of its shape. It is made of white marble and reaches a height of approximately 73 meters (240 feet) from the base. The dome is adorned with a lotus design and features a finial on top, which is said to represent the pinnacle of heaven.
Minerates: There are four minarets, one at each corner of the platform surrounding the central tomb. These minarets are approximately 40 meters (130 feet) tall and are designed to tilt slightly outward. This architectural feature was intentional to prevent them from falling onto the main tomb in case of an earthquake.
Calligraphy:The Taj Mahal is adorned with intricate calligraphy from the Quranic inscriptions. The calligraphy is made from black marble inlaid into the white marble, and it decorates the exterior walls of the mausoleum.
Gardens : The Taj Mahal is adorned with intricate calligraphy from the Quranic inscriptions. The calligraphy is made from black marble inlaid into the white marble, and it decorates the exterior walls of the mausoleum.
Reflecting pool: In front of the Taj Mahal is a long reflecting pool that enhances the symmetry and provides stunning reflections of the monument, especially during sunrise and sunset.
Interior:The interior of the Taj Mahal houses the tombs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan. The cenotaphs (empty tombs) are beautifully adorned with semi-precious stones and intricate designs. The actual graves are located in a chamber below the main level, which is not open to the public.</p>
